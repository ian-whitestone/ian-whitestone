Hey Ian!
Sorry for contacting you in this way, but I haven't found another workaround.

Thank you a lot for composing the article about randomization <> analysis unit
It makes a great job of describing the problem in a very intuitive way.
I wanted to share it with my data science colleagues, so they can learn about it,
but I think there's a critical typo in the variance formula in the delta method - 
The first term should be Var(S)/N^2, not Var(S)/N - this is stated in the original paper:
page 3 formula 4) and it aligns with my calculations.

I hope you'd be able to find time to fix it.

Thanks!
Alexander
